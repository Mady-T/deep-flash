* Problem: Size of deck input into model can vary
* Solutions:
    - Make input size fixed at 100 cards (say)
        + If exceeding 100 cards, use heuristics to filter which cards to feed to model.
        + If lower than 100 cards, (while training), input  cards spread randomly into input neurons to prevent model from becoming 'top-heavy'
